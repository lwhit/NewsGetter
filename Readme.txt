Project by Logan Whitmire
Completed on 9 December 2015

Purpose: To search Google News for a key word. If the key word is found on 
the website, then a picture of a dog informs you of this.
If we can not find the key word on Google News, then you get a blank page :/

Original intention of the project could not be met on time. Original intention
was to display the link given for a story that corresponds with the key word.

Unfortunately, could not make this happen. I was still able to provide user
feedback though by displaying different websites depending on the actions
of the program. 

Running instructions: Open project in XCode and run with simulator. I ran it
using an iPhone 6 simulator, the display has constraints though so it should
display properly in any setting.
